# OptiRoute: Intelligent Travel Route Planner
This proposal outlines the workflow and plans for the NYCU NSD term project in Autumn 2023.

## Basic Information
OptiRoute deals with the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for multiple global destinations.

In this project, we aim to develop a user-friendly system. 
After the users provide the latitude and longitude coordinates for multiple destinations, 
the system will generate efficient travel routes. 
We hope that it can be utilized for logistics,tour planning, and resource optimization.

### Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
TSP is a NP hard problem. 
Given a set of cities and the distance between every pair of cities, 
the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once 
and returns back to the original city. 

### Christofides algorithm
The Christofides algorithm is an approximation algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) 
that offers a good trade-off between solution quality and computational efficiency. 
It guarantees a solution within 1.5 times the optimal solution by using techniques like MST, 
minimum-weight perfect matching, Eulerian circuit.

### Haversine Formula
The Haversine Formula determines the great-circle distance 
between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes.

## Problem to Solve
Optimizing travel routes for multiple destinations is a common challenge in various fields. 
The problem involves finding the shortest route, 
which becomes increasingly complex as the number of destinations increases. 
Existing solutions are often lacking in user-friendliness.

This project aims to create a user-friendly system that allows users 
to input destination latitude and longitude coordinates. 
We'll then use the `Haversine formula` and 
the approximation algorithm `Christofides Algorithm` for the TSP 
to find the most efficient travel route. 
This project bridges the gap between theory and practical application, 
providing an accessible solution for optimized travel planning.
